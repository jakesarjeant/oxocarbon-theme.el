#+title: oxocarbon-theme.el

This is a port of the [[https://github.com/nyoom-engineering/oxocarbon.nvim][oxocarbon.nvim]] theme for emacs. Because it's a pretty theme.

This is not a 100% complete port — quite a few of the less common faces haven't been defined yet — but it's more complete than any of the other emacs ports I could find. Feel free to open a PR if you notice anything I've missed!
